   <p>Node that sends <b>msg</b> on the schedule supplied in the string <b>msg.later</b>

   <p>The schedule is any string that can be parsed by <b>later.parse.text()</b>.</p>
   <p>The setting <b>schedule</b> is used in preference to anything in <b>msg.later</b>. 
   If no schedule is supplied the <b>msg</b> is sent straight out. In the case where the 
    schedule is invalid, node.warn will be called with the offending schedule and the 
    processing continues as if there was no schedule.</p>
